# Password-Encryption-and-Decryption
The project is about password encryption and decryption using brute force algorithm and crypt library. The code runs perfectly on Linux Ubuntu. If you want to run it on windows, you have to configure a encryption decryption library. Because Crypt library is not available on Windows. The password input for encryption is of the form "AB22".
